<h1>Techknowledgist - Technology Classifier</h1>

<p class="abstract">The technology classifier takes feature files created by the
document processing code and generates technology scores for all terms in those
documents. It runs off a corpus or a list of files, generates a technology score
for each term in each document, and then summarizes the score over the corpus or
list of files.</p>

<a name="installation"></a>
<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Requirements for running the code:</p>

<ol>
<li>Python 2.7
<li>Java 1.8 (Java 1.6 or 1.7 will probably also work)
<li>Git (needed only if you want to get the code via a git clone)
</ol>

<p>The code has been tested on Linux RHEL 6 and recent Mac OS 10 systems. The
code has not been tested on Windows, but there are no major reasons that would
prevent this code from running on it.</p>


<p>Installation is a matter of getting the code, installing the MALLET tools,
downloading the classifier models, and setting up your configuration.</p>


<ol>

<li>Getting and installing the code.

<p>If you downloaded the code as an archive then all you need to do is unpack it
  somewhere in a directory without spaces in its path. If you do not have the
  full archive, you obtain the code by cloning
  the <a href="https://github.com/techknowledgist/tgist-classifiers"
  target="_blank">git repository</a>:

<pre class="example">
$ git clone https://github.com/techknowledgist/tgist-classifiers
</pre>

<p>After getting the clone, you need to initialize and update the submodules
used by the repository:</p>

<pre class="example">
$ cd tgist-classifiers
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update 
</pre>

<!-- NOTE: this does not seem to be needed for the technology classifier. -->

<li>Installing MALLET. The code uses version 2.0.7 of the Mallet
toolkit<sup>1</sup>, available at <a href="http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/"
target="_blank">http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/</a>. Other versions will most likely
work as well, but were not tested. You can get the version we use at

<blockquote>
<a href="http://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~marc/fuse/downloads/tools/"
target="_blank">http://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~marc/fuse/downloads/tools/</a>
</blockquote>

<li>Classifier models. There are small classifer models (for technology
classification and key term extraction) bundled in with the code, which is
sufficient when you just try to see if the code runs, but eventually you will
want to get a better model. Technology classifier models are available at:

<blockquote>
<a href="http://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~marc/fuse/downloads/models/"
target="_blank">http://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~marc/fuse/downloads/models/</a>
</blockquote>

<p>NOTE: need to add models</p>

<p>There is currently only one model available. You can create as many models as
  you want by following directions in the <a href="../../00-readme.txt">readme
  file</a> in the classifier directory.</p>

</li>

<li>Configuration. Copy the configuration file <code>config-sample.py</code>
into <code>config.py</code> and edit as needed. The only thing needed in the
configuration file is the location of Mallet. Note that this step is not
strictly necessary since the location of Mallet can be handed in to the main
script with an command line option (see below).</li>
    
</ol>



<a name="input"></a>
<h2>Input requirements</h2>

<p>The input to the classifier is taken from the feature files that are the
endpoint of processing by the Technowledgist feature extraction code
at <a href="https://github.com/techknowledgist/tgist-features">https://github.com/techknowledgist/tgist-features</a>. Input
can be given as a complete corpus as created by the feature extraction code or
as a list of files. In the former case the code picks out the right files from
the corpus. The input files have lines in the following format:</p>

<pre class="example">
term_id year term feature+
</pre>

<p>All fields, including the features, are tab-separated. The
<code>term_id</code> is the name of an input file followed by an underscore and
a number. Each feature is made up of a name and a value, for
example <code>next2_tags=IN_NN</code>. An example corpus is included in this
repository at <a href="../../data/corpora/sample-us">data/corpora/sample-us</a>
and a few lines from one of the feature files in there are
in <a href="features.txt">features.txt</a>.


<a name="howto"></a>
<h2>Running the classifier</h2>

<p>The top-level script for running the technology classifier is
<a href=../../run_tclassify.py>run_tclassify.py<a>. The classifier needs to be
run from the directory it is in and as mentioned before it can take either a
corpus or a list of files as input.</p>


<h3>Running on a corpus</h3>

<p>To run the classifier on a corpus, you can do something like the following.</p>

<pre class="example">
$ python run_tclassify.py 
    --classify 
    --corpus data/corpora/sample-us
    --model data/models/technologies-010-20140911/train.model 
    --output data/sample-us 
</pre>

<p>Note that this should be a one-line command, it is spread out over several
lines here for clarity. Change the <code>--corpus</code> option depending on
where your corpus lives. The corpus used in this example is the sample corpus
included in the distribution. Use
the <code><span class="nowrap">--output</span></code> option to specify what
directory classification results are written to.  The <code>--model</code>
option here uses the model that is shipped with the code. This model is
sufficient when you just try to see if the code runs, but eventually you will
want to get a better model. Example out put that should be similar to what's
created by the command above is
in <a href="../../data/classifications/sample-us">data/classifications/sample-us</a>.</p>

<p>The command above assumes that Mallet is installed at the location specified
in <code>config.py</code>, you can override this location with
the <code>--mallet-dir</code> option:</p>

<pre class="example">
$ python run_tclassify.py 
    --classify 
    --corpus data/corpora/sample-us
    --model data/models/technologies-010-20140911/train.model 
    --output data/sample-us
    --mallet-dir /tools/mallet/mallet-2.0.7/bin  
</pre>

<p>Use the <code>--verbose</code> option to print verbose messages, which
includes writing all files read by the classifier.</p>

<p>It takes about 2-3 minutes to classify 1000 patents on a regular
desktop. Processing time scales linearly.</p>


<h3>Running on a list of files</h3>

<p>You do not need an actual corpus to run the classifier. Instead you can provide
a file that contains a list of input files that need to be classified.</p>

<pre class="example">
$ python run_tclassify.py
    --classify
    --filelist lists/list-sample-us
    --model data/models/technologies-010-20140911/train.model
    --output data/classifications/list-sample-us.txt
</pre>

<p>This command uses an example file list
in <a href="../../ontology/classifier/lists/list-sample-us.txt"
target="_blank">list-sample-us.txt</a>, which refers to the feature files in
the <code>sample-us</code> example corpus. One thing to note about this list is
that the file paths do not include the .gz extenson. The code itself figures out
whether the file is compressed or not. Again, change <code>--output</code>
and <code>--filelist</code> as needed and add <code>--mallet-dir</code> if
Mallet is not installed on a default location.</p>


<a name="output"></a>
<h2>Output description</h2>

<p>The classification results for the files in the corpus or file list are
concatenated and put in the output directory, which has the following
content:</p>

<pre class="example">
classify.MaxEnt.out.gz
classify.MaxEnt.out.s1.all_scores.gz
classify.MaxEnt.out.s2.y_scores
classify.MaxEnt.out.s3.scores.sum
classify.MaxEnt.out.s4.scores.sum.az
classify.MaxEnt.out.s4.scores.sum.nr
classify.MaxEnt.stderr
classify.info.filelist.txt
classify.info.general.txt
classify.mallet.gz
</pre>

<p>The last file is the file with the input to the classifier. The first file
contains the raw results of the classifier and the second just the yes scores
from the raw results. The results have scores not for each term occurrence but
for each term in a document.  The file that one is most likely to use
is <code>classify.MaxEnt.out.s3.scores.sum</code>, which has lines as
follows:</p>

<pre class="example">
senses flag	0.439934	1	0.439934	0.439934
text message	0.342870	2	0.225453	0.460288
</pre>

<p>The columns contain: the term, the technology score over the entire corpus or
list of files, the number of documents in the corpus or file list that the term
occurs in, the lowest score, and the highest score.</p>
